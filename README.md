## My process
This time I tried to put the font-sizes, gaps, margins,paddings into variables and just change the variables on media queries. This reduced the confusion about what gaps and paddings I had used earlier and repetition was made easy.
I go with the mobile first design.
Instead of margins, I set the blocks display layout as flex and use gap property to assign spacings. This ensures more uniformity and less code for me. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I could place the image in the content property of before and after pseudo properties. It helped a lot.


### Continued development

Use variables more effectively to define font-sizes and gaps and paddings..
